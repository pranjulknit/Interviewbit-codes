// Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integers C of size N. 
Element C[i] represents the length of ith board.
//  You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. 
There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of the board.

// Calculate and return the minimum time required to paint all boards 
under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of the board.
//  NOTE: 
//  1. 2 painters cannot share a board to paint. That is to say, 
a board cannot be painted partially by one painter, and partially by another.
//  2. A painter will only paint contiguous boards. This means a configuration where painter 1 paints boards 1 and 3 but not 2 is invalid.

//  Return the ans % 10000003.



// Problem Constraints
// 1 <= A <= 1000

// 1 <= B <= 106

// 1 <= N <= 105

// 1 <= C[i] <= 106



// Input Format
// The first argument given is the integer A.

// The second argument given is the integer B.

// The third argument given is the integer array C.
